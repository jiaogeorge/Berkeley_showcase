This is a repository for W200 Spring 2021, Project 2.
The first PDF file is the final report.
Code is included as the second file. 
Rest of the pictures are the ones to be used for generating "mosaic" style pictures. Please keep them as the same location of the Python Code if you are trying the code. 

Team members: Stephanie He, George Jiao, and Tiantian Zhao
Our team has analyzed over 470,000 pieces of artworks collected by the Met Museum, through a python-based data analysis, and have included the findings and analysis in this repository.
